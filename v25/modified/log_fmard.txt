1. Fixed typo in graphs.csv: "Commerical N application for agriculture" -> "Commercial N application for agriculture"
(it generated undefined variable names)
2. Changed "Total GHG Emissions from Agriculture" to "Total CO2 Emissions from Agriculture" in graphs.csv 
(it generated undefined variable names)
3. Changed "Healthy life expectancy at birth" to "Healthy life expectancy at birth[Male]" and "Healthy life expectancy at birth[Female]" 
(because 'plot 1 variable' in graphs.csv needs to be of type 'double' and not of type 'double[2]' array)
4. Provided an example graphs.csv for Stacked Graph (in folder 'stacked_graphs_example')
5. Provided an example inputs.csv for Switch Type Variable (in folder 'switch_type_example')
6. Provided a bigger config folder example (in folder 'config_v25_fixedV1_multiline')

FOR STACKED GRAPHS:
in graphs.csv:
- change "kind" to "stacked-line"
- change all "plot X style" to "area"

FOR SWITCH TYPE VARIABLE:
in inputs.csv:
- change "input type" to "switch"
- at "controlled input ids" put eg. (previous csv value),2;3|4;5,(next csv value) (this means that: 2,3 are active when the switch is off, and 4,5 are active when the switch is on.)

TODO:
(!) Still can't make the "v25.vdfx" file ("plot 1 source") work. Can't correctly recognize the "v25.vdfx" file as input.
ERROR: No data available for _arable_land (source=v25.vdfx)
